00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.800
This country will never
be tainted by cafe sieges
 
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.976
we will always ride together

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.976
from the mountains
where the bush fires rage

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.976
we stand together
down to the shore

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.976
where the lifesavers age
 
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.533
under that great Southern Sun

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.976
My Australia is one

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.976
where women wear their
sarees and their

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.467
colourful hijabs proudly


00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.600
men don sweat stained collars
like war badges

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.733
You can get the best
fur in Sydney

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.600
The realist Lebanese and
Chinese and you feel at ease

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.976
because no one judges
your garlic breath

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.976
or the tabbouleh
stuck in your teeth

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.667
It is a place where
you can get the most

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.600
authentic spices in
shops where foreign

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.976
signs sit like
jewelled crowns atop

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.976
their doors

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.533
It is neighbours passing
barbecued meat

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.976
over the fence and
always saying hello

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.976
It is all the stoic
traditions, it is stoic

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.833
a community that's been 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.976
hardened by media headlines
It is targeted it is judged 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.200
it is 3:00 a.m.
sirens and

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.667
perceived thugs but
it is also where the

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.976
call to prayer

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.467
gently interludes with 
the ringing of church bells

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.467
It is coexistence
artistic resistance

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
like the four elements
youth hip hop festival

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.976
and the largest poetry slam
in the country

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.333
It is my dad's voice 
twenty-five years on

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.467
accent thick with resilience

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.533
warm like an autumn
breeze smelling of

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.976
petrol and truck
smoke and all the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.976
forgotten things all
those art are in

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.976
detainee and the
crushed petals that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.400
were once dreams
saying to me "We are lucky"

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.600
It's not perfect
but it's home 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.667
It will never be perfect
but it will always be home

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.667
My Australia is home when the
rest of the world says no
